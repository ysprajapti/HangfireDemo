Hangfire is a .NET-based background job processing library that allows you to run tasks asynchronously and reliably in the background without blocking your main application. It is especially useful for running delayed, scheduled, recurring, or long-running background jobs like:

Sending emails
Processing files
Generating reports
Database cleanups
Payment processing
